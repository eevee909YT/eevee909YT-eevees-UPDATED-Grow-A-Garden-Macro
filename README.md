eevee's UPDATED Grow A Garden Macro
An UPDATED macro for the Roblox game "Grow a Garden" because Virage hasn't updated theirs in uh a very long time
Installation
⦁	First of all, you need to download AutoHotKey v1.1 (Not 2.0), and run the installer
⦁	Once complete, download the most recent version of the eevee's UPDATED Grow A Garden Macro through the most recent GitHub Release (Download source code ZIP)
⦁	After downloading, extract the ZIP file to your desired directory
Before starting the macro:
⦁	ensure you extracted the macro file
⦁	don't go full screen, be in windowed fullscreen
⦁	Set your roblox camera mode to the following --> default(classic)
⦁	put "Recall Wrench" in the 2nd hot bar slot --> macro may bug out and not automatically do it
⦁	I doubt you need to have at least 5-10 things in your hotbar but go ahead if you want
⦁	make sure UI Navigation is turned ON in your Roblox settings
⦁	unequip your “grey mouse” pet if you have some equipped since they give you a speed bonus that will break the macro
